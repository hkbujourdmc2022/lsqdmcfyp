							<h3>35 years old curse</h3>
							
							
							<p>35 is the end of the youth stage and the beginning of middle age. China's official "Medium- and Long-Term Development Plan for Youth (2016-2025)"  defines the age range of youth as 14 to 35. </p>
							<p>The curse of 35 refers to companies explicitly or implicitly choosing candidates under the age of 35 when recruiting. When a person reaches the age of 35, their career advancement opportunities at their current workplace begin to narrow, and it becomes increasingly challenging to find suitable jobs when re-entering the job market.							</p>
							
							
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
									
									<p> Research from University of Pennsylvania shows that the age-income distribution in the job market is inverted U-shaped. Top of the inverted U-shaped curve is regarded as the "golden age." Another research, conducted by professors from Dartmouth College in the United States and the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom, shows that individuals in 55 nations reach a low point in their mental well-being around the age of 46, whereas China reaches a low point at the age of 36. </p>

								<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
									<br />
									<p>Before 2000, the "golden age" in the United States and China remained stable at around 50 to 55 years old. After 2000, the golden age in the United States remained unchanged, but China's golden age continued to decline, falling to 35 years old after 2005."</p>

							<p>Both recent graduates and big tech companies share a mutual desire to work with each other, with corporations actively seeking younger talent to gain a competitive edge in the industry.

									<p>A study from the University of Pennsylvania divides the reasons for changes in wages with age into three categories: work experience, time effects (changes in average wage levels for different years), and cohort effects (differences in worker abilities for each generation). They found that the time and cohort effects for different generations in the United States are small, but in China, they have a huge impact. For Chinese workers, due to changes in industry structure and the rapid evolution of workers' education levels, the changes in wages brought about by time and cohort effects are far higher than the value of personal work experience growth. As shown in the graph, in China, wages begin to decline with age starting at around 35 years old. In other words, 35-year-old employees are the most valuable. Physiologically speaking, 35 is not the beginning of a comprehensive decline in physical and psychological quality. In fact, the midlife crisis often occurs gradually between the ages of 40 and 50 globally.</p>

							<p>However, in internet companies, elimination and renewal are the norm, and the age crisis will not wait until the age of 35 to arrive. In early 2021, Maimai released the "Internet Talent Mobility Report 2020", which showed that the average age of employees in 19 top internet companies nationwide was 29.6 years old, with ByteDance and Pinduoduo having an average age of only 27 years old. In 2020, when NetEase was listed in Hong Kong for the second time, CEO and director Ding Lei released a shareholder letter stating that "NetEase in the future will establish a self-evolving organization that will always stay at the age of 29." The letter also revealed that during the 20 years of expansion from 221 employees to over 20,000 employees, the average age of NetEase employees has always been kept below 29 years old.

							<h3>a stepping stone, not a final destination</h3>
							<p>As the various positions and functions of China's internet tech giants continue to become more specialized, employee autonomy and creativity are being replaced by institutionalized management and division of labor. "Although I'm in a rapidly developing industry, the business cross-section that many employees can come into contact with is actually very small. Many times, I don't know how much impact my work has on the overall business. I feel like a small screw inside a big machine," said Dong Lue, a formal intern at NetEase and Bytedance. Due to the inability of small companies to bear many employees, employees often have multiple job skills, which has led many employees of tech giants to face career crises around the age of 35 and find it difficult to find their next destination outside of tech giants. </p>
							<p>"Due to the lack of personnel, small companies need more versatile talents, while in tech giants, employees can often excel in several skills, but lack experience in other skills," Sharon Lu said," For most employees, tech giants can only serve as a stepping stone, rather than a final destination."</p>
