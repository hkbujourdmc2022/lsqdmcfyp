								<h3>Fierce competition</h3>
							<p>Chen Taoming, a senior student at SiChuan university who has been accepted into Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. in February, looks back on his interview experience and says that being recruited by Huawei was a little talent plus a lot of luck.</p>

								Chen's table used to record recruitment information.

							<p>In August 2022, Chen created a spring recruitment spreadsheet and compiled all the job postings he found acceptable. The "written test" and "first interview" columns on the spreadsheet were filled with Chen's schedule. To accommodate the test schedule of internet companies, he sometimes had to take two or even three tests in one night, submitting the answers just before dawn. However, most of the positions were marked as "rejected" or no longer received any response.</p>
							<p>Excluding the time Chen spent doing practice exams at home during winter break, it took him six months to find a job. After completing over 40 written tests and more than 20 interviews, he finally received a satisfactory offer from a major smartphone company, Huawei. "Before receiving the offer from Huawei, I also got a few other offers, but I was not satisfied with them. I got tons of pressure and had trouble sleeping every week," he said. When he received the offer, he became calm and felt that his value was recognized.</p>
							<p>Even so, Chen is one of the lucky ones among many freshers.</p>
							<p>Statistics from the Chinese Ministry of Education shows that the number of college graduates in China in 2022 was 10.76 million, the first time in history to surpass the 10 million mark. The estimated number of college graduates in 2023 is 11.58 million. As a huge proportion of graduates are seeking employment, coveted position within a tech giant has grown increasingly challenging. The "College Graduates Employment Report" released by Zhaopin Ltd shows that the CIER (Employment Prosperity Index) of college graduates in the first quarter of 2022 dropped to its lowest level since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020, with only 0.71, while the value for the same period last year was 1.34. At the same time, recruitment demand in the internet and education industries has been significantly reduced.</p>
							<p>According to the Zhaopin Recruitment's "2022 Spring Recruitment Market Weekly Report," the job market was highly competitive and active after the Spring Festival in 2022. The competition index doubled compared to the same period in the previous year, with the number of resumes sent increasing significantly. The competition index was 11.3, which means on average each position received 11 resumes per month. This is almost double the competition index during the first week after the Spring Festival in 2021, which was 6.2.</p>
							
							<h3>endless recruitment process</h3>
							<p>Chen said, 'ByteDance's technical position recruitment test this year had four programming questions, and I only solved one.' He is majoring in software engineering at Sichuan University, one of China's top universities. According to his simulation test results, his average level is solving two questions and completing 30% of the other two, indicating that the recruitment test difficulty has increased significantly. 'I don't understand what kind of people ByteDance wants, or why the questions are so difficult.' Chen said.</p>
							<p>Test-taking skills for cognitive ability tests and personality assessments are necessary, in addition to strong technical skills. John Nie, a student studying at Beijing Forestry University, participated in Meituan's product operation position this year. Two weeks before the written test, he spent an average of one hour each day practicing cognitive ability tests and reading strategies on various forums, but he still got stuck on the math questions during the exam. "I can't recall the specific questions, they were mostly decryption, and I didn't understand many of them," he said. On the other hand, JingYu Cui, who had previously participated in civil servant exam training, felt that he had an advantage as he found similarities between the questions in cognitive ability tests of giant tech companies and civil servant exams. When preparing for the test, he reviewed the previous civil servant exam questions he had done, and eventually passed the test of three companies.</p>
							<p>Edward Lin, a former HR employee at ByteDance, understands the necessity of big companies setting these basic screening standards: "Every year, thousands of job seekers apply to big companies, and establishing these basic screening standards would greatly reduce the workload of HR."</p>
							<p>If participants pass the written test, they will generally go to multiple rounds of business and HR interviews. Chen's fall recruiting mostly stops at one and two interviews. Chen's resume is all about some projects he did at home, not much internship experience, and the thank you letter from the big company was a signal to end the process. He asked the interviewer why he was rejected, and received the response, "You don't have a good understanding of the product development position."</p>
							<p>"Even if skills match, the process may be terminated due to a sudden lack of headcount. John Nie passed all of Didi's business interviews, but was suddenly informed in the final HR interview that the company had reduced its recruitment quotas and she could not receive an offer. Rumors about changes in headcount among tech giants are circulating on social media, and after completing Tencent's written test, Chen saw a post on Weibo (China's mainstream social media platform) claiming that the position he had applied for had already been filled by another applicant and there were no more openings, leaving him feeling powerless and insecure.</p>

							<p>According to Maimai's data, the number of job seekers in the pure internet industry decreased by 19.8% in 2022, while the number of job positions in this industry decreased by 50.4%, resulting in a significant increase in competition. Difficult written test questions, strict requirements for perfect matches during interviews, and sudden Head Count reductions have made new graduates feel that companies that are in internet industry have an unwillingness to recruit.</p>
							<p>"Basically, what can be released are social recruitment posts, and large factories looks forward to experienced skilled workers." Lusha, former HR of Haoweilai, said that in addition to the regular school recruiting channels, the only options left for freshers in large factories are internships.</p>
