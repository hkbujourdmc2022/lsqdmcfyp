							<h3>Jumping off the Internet industry, more young people are pursuing government jobs</h3>
							<!-- <div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div> -->

							<p>As the unemployment rate remains high, many young workers are considering government jobs. The number of applicants for the 2022 Chinese National Civil Service Exam reached 4.57 million, with a year-on-year increase of 800,000 people, representing a growth rate of 21%.Among this huge army of candidates, only about 1 million will be admitted, while 1.5 million candidates will end up with nothing.</p>
							<p>This is in contrast to the situation in the 1990s, when many public servants resigned to become individual business owners or entrepreneurs - a phenomenon known as "Xiahai" or "jumping into the sea". Today's Generation Z are giving up their dreams of becoming wealthy and choosing low-paying but stable state-owned jobs. Obtaining a job in a state-owned enterprise is called "getting on board" - it's considered a secure position.</p>
							<p>Three years ago, after graduating from Fudan University's graduate school in Shanghai, Wan Yang joined the product department of JD.com. Although she enjoyed the internet company's free cafeteria and youthful culture, the pressure, overtime, and instability of the job made her feel disgusted.</p>
							<p>In April, after resigning from JD.com, Wang found a job as a product manager at a state-owned enterprise in Shanghai. In addition to a nearly 50% pay cut, she also had to adapt to a completely different workplace culture: unlike the tech industry, her colleagues didn't work overtime or during holidays. The average age of the staff was 35, and her colleagues prioritized family education outside of work. The organizational structure was stable, but promotion opportunities were limited. Social etiquette was emphasized, and projects required several rounds of approval from upper management.
							</p>
							<p>Wang is very satisfied with her current life. She finishes work at 5 pm every day and exercises. "The best decision I made in 2022 was to quit the internet company. I now go to bed early and wake up early, my emotions are stable, and I've lost 20 kilograms due to work-life balance. I've also developed many interests, such as dancing and reading."

							<h3>Jumping off the Internet industry, more young people are pursuing government jobs</h3>

							<p>In the report "Talent Attraction 2020", Maimai said that the overall job happiness satisfaction of Internet industry workers ranked at the bottom of all industries, tied with trade, wholesale and retail, agriculture, forestry and fishery industries. Work pressure, work intensity, and future development space are the main factors that pull down the happiness of employees in the Internet industry. In these three aspects, the average satisfaction score of Internet people is only 2.81, 2.91 and 3.02, while the full score is 5.</p>
							<p>Dylan Wu described 'instability' as a key term to characterize his employer Tencent. Giant tech companies always have a fresh supply of talent, and the project teams often have a strong sense of crisis. Structural layoffs are common, which may result in both projects and people being replaced. Wang Xin, who works at the top short video platform Huya, was told that her department would no longer operate within just one month of her employment. 'I was stunned when I received this news,' she said. She was subsequently reassigned to a position that had nothing to do with the job she had applied for. Wangxin's experience is becoming increasingly common among employees of tech giants like her employer. Wang Xin did not resign. On the one hand, high salaries and benefits can partly offset some negative emotions. On the other hand, those who have survived the internal competition within the company are considered 'winners.' Leaving means facing new competition again."</p>
							<p>In addition, the more pressing issue for employees of these internet companies is: where should they go next once they leave? Is the outside world really better?</p>
							<p>"Work specialization is relatively high in large technology companies, making it difficult to find a job that perfectly matches one's skills outside of the industry. Those who hope to move to a better job often find that salaries offered by big companies are higher than those of other companies, making it hard to meet their expectations if they switch to another industry. " Dylan said.
							</p>
							<p>Cui Jingyu has worked at Pinduoduo for two years and gained 20 pounds due to continuous overtime and irregular eating habits. Since August 2022, he has communicated with more than 20 companies on Maimai, but none of them have panned out. "The salaries offered by giant tech companies are too high. Switching jobs would mean a 30% to 40% pay cut, which is unacceptable," he said.</p>
							<p>Some employees are reluctant to give up everything they already have, and Cindy Liu shares the same concern. ByteDance offers the highest salary level within the same position, as well as free meals, gym access, and housing subsidies. "Although the work is tiring, the salary and benefits are good. Actually, any job is hard. What if I change jobs and the new one pays less and is even more tiring?"
							</p>
							<p>"if I decides to change jobs, it will not be because of the job itself, but because my health cannot handle it, or because I am about to move on to the next stage of my life, such as getting married and having children,"Cui said. For now, she wants to work comfortably in this position and minimize the time and opportunity costs of changing jobs. If lucky, she hopes to be promoted and get a raise. "When I start a family, my family will be my top priority, and then I'll look for an easier job."</p>
							<p>"In fact, many of my colleagues plan to leave when their health deteriorates. This is not really a choice, but more like a joke that life plays on us. Cindy Liu said."
							</p>
							<p>But even so, many of the former waves hesitate to stay in the siege for a year and a year, and there are many young waves rushing toward that siege.</p>
							<p>Wan Yang occasionally chats with her former colleagues and she feels that these people trapped inside the "gilded birdcage" are very pitiful. "Big tech employees traded their health for money in the first 10 years, and then traded their money for health in the second half of their lives. This world is diverse, yet it seems that the brilliance of big tech is too dazzling, and too many workers have trapped themselves in the values of big tech, consuming themselves," she said.</p>
