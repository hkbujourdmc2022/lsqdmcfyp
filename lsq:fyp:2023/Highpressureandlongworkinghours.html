								<h3>「996」to 「Flexible work time」</h3>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/xiabangaofeng.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								
								<p>Competitive salaries and great benefits, along with the pessimistic job market, making jobs in these tech giants appear too valuable for young talents to give up. But when the basic welfare of employees seems to be in danger, will the situation still be good? In 2020, a 22-year-old female employee of Chinese e-commerce giant Pinduoduo died suddenly after working for a long time past midnight, sparking discussions on social media about the infamous 996 overwork culture in the tech industry. 996 refers to the unofficial work schedule of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week, which has long been known among people working in China's rapidly growing tech industry. </p>

										<p>In March 2019, a group of Chinese programmers launched a repository called 996ICU on Microsoft's code hosting service GitHub. The activity collected data shared by more than 4,000 employees from companies such as Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba, and showed that many people worked about 12 hours a day. One part of 996 said, "If you always follow the '996' working schedule, you are likely to end up in the ICU."</p>

								<p>In April 2019, Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, responded to public criticism of "996" on Weibo, stating that the "996" schedule was a "huge blessing," and adding that any Alibaba employee who wanted to succeed should be prepared to work 12 hours a day. However, after his comments sparked criticism, he responded on Weibo by stating that 'no company should force employees to work 996'.</p>
								<p>'If you like your work, you should work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week - even longer hours.' - Jack Ma.</p>
								<p>It was reported that Richard Liu Qiangdong, founder of Alibaba's competitor JD.com, also criticized employees who did not work hard enough as "lazy." In an article on WeChat, he said his company did not force employees to work according to the "996" schedule, but encouraged every employee of JD.com to strive for excellence. Liu also said that he could work according to the "8116+8" schedule, which meant working from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. on weekdays and Saturdays, and working 8 hours on Sundays.</p>

										<p>In 2021, a movement called "Workers' Lives Matter," later renamed "Working Hours," reignited a debate about the harsh "996" corporate culture of technology companies. More than 5,000 employees from the tech industry released their detailed work schedules on an open-access spreadsheet, including company name, position, and work hours. They shared their experiences at work and protested against excessively long working hours.</p>

								<p>However, the infamous "996 work culture" has not stopped undergraduates from competing for positions in tech giants. When Chen entered the final round of interviews at Huawei, a human resources officer asked him how he viewed overtime work. Chen said he was very willing to work overtime and agreed with the culture of working overtime. "Of course, I don't agree. No one wants to work overtime. But if I disagree, I will not get this job. And tech giants are often willing to pay high overtime pay, so I don't object to working overtime," Chen said.</p>
								<p>Hengxuan Ji, a senior student at Hong Kong Baptist University who interned at Didi, said, "I think the working environment of big companies is encouraging employers to work overtime." Didi offers free dinner after 7:30 pm and also pays for taxi fares after 8 pm. "Technically, we can go home at 6:30 pm, but usually my mentor will stay late. She and some other employees will finish dinner around 7:30 pm and work for another hour before going home around 9 pm."</p>
								<p>The flexible work system is increasing the working hours of internet professionals. Dylan Wu, a game planner who worked at Tencent for two years, said that Tencent adheres to "Flexible work time." The flexible work system allows employees to independently choose the specific time arrangement of their work, provided that they complete their daily work tasks, instead of a uniform, fixed system of work hours. Tencent implements a flexible off-duty system, where employees start work at 9:30 am every day and leave after completing their daily tasks. Dylan arrives at the office punctually at 9:30 am every day and leaves around 10:30 pm, with an average daily working hours of 11 hours, excluding the two-hour lunch break. "Tencent employees can leave work immediately after 6 pm if their daily work is completed. However, unless their efficiency is high, it cannot be completed without spending a long time," Dylan said. </p>
								<p>According to Article 36 of the Labor Law of the People's Republic of China, the daily working time for workers shall not exceed eight hours, and the average weekly working time shall not exceed 44 hours. When asked about overtime pay, Dylan responded indifferently, "Even if I work until 10:30 pm, it is considered normal working hours, not overtime, so there is no overtime pay."</p>

										<br /><br /><br />
										<p>According to Talent Mobility in China 2022 conducted by Maimai, balancing work and life is not a top priority for today's undergraduates when looking for their first job. However, Hengxuan Ji and Ellen Zeng both stated that they would not consider working for an Internet giant company in the future unless there are no better options available.</p>

								<p>Hengxuan Ji said that achieving a work-life balance will be a top priority for her in future work. " I believe that it's possible to have a successful career and a fulfilling personal life, and I want to strive for both," said Hengxuan Ji.</p>
