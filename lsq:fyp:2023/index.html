							<p>“Da chang” a Chinese word meaning “big factory”, is an Internet-evolved term. Programmers, designers, operators, and other workers working in Internet companies describe their work as working in a factory-like environment surrounded by walls. In traditional manufacturing industries, processing plant workers sit on factory assembly lines and work non-stop. Similarly, in bustling cities and skyscrapers, internet workers now perform computerized, process-oriented work.</p>
							<p>Although there is no official list, “Dachang” in the Internet industry in China generally refers to nine Internet tech giants: Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance, Meituan, DiDi, JinDong, NetEase, and Kuaishou. Nowadays, the meaning of entering a Dachang has gradually evolved to refer to working in enterprises that are populous, large-scale, well-compensated, and highly recognized. As of February 2022, the Chinese companies with the largest market capitalization listed in Hong Kong and U.S. stocks are Internet companies (Tencent, Alibaba). According to the Global Unicorn Index 2022 Half-Year Report, the highest valued Chinese company not yet listed is an Internet company: Douyin. The Internet industry has become the biggest economic miracle in China in the past two decades, and is also the most wealth-creating industry.</p>

									<p>Every year, countless Chinese young people are eager to flock to this industry that represents the "future". According to Maimai's "2020 Talent Attraction Report", IT and the Internet are the biggest talent net inflows, far surpassing the second and third largest industries. In 2021, the China Youth Daily conducted a questionnaire of 5,868 university students in China, and the results showed that more than 80% of the university students expressed interest in pursuing a career in the internet industry. ByteDance, Huawei, and Alibaba have emerged as the top three most coveted companies among young people seeking employment opportunities." Yimeng Zhang, a senior student at Hong Kong Baptist University, has chosen ByteDance as her first internship company. "As a leading internet company, ByteDance can provide better learning opportunities for newcomers, and its reputation and endorsement can be helpful for my future job prospects," she said.</p>

							<p>The Internet has attracted the most talented and outstanding young people in China. From the perspective of universities, graduates from comprehensive universities and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) universities are more favored by big companies. Graduates from top universities such as Nanjing University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Tsinghua University, and the University of Science and Technology of China are distributed among many internet giants. Compared to previous years, the number of graduates from these top universities who chose to work in the internet industry in 2020 has also significantly increased.</p>

								Note: "985 institutions" refers to a project launched by China in May 1998 to build a group of high-level universities, with 39 universities selected, which are considered to be among the best universities in China.
"211 institutions" refers to a project launched by the Chinese government in November 1995 to build 100 institutions of higher education institutions for the 21st century, including all "985 institutions". Double-class institutions refer to those institutions that are both "985" institutions and "211" institutions.

							<h3>High payment & Great benefits</h3>
							<p>According to data from Maimai, a Chinese professional networking and job search platform, Alibaba Group Holding is the highest-paying technology company in China, with an average monthly salary of 33,500 yuan (approximately $5,000), surpassing ByteDance and Tencent Holdings, whose average monthly salaries are 32,800 yuan and 30,800 yuan, respectively. The remuneration package for equivalent roles in the internet sector is notably more substantial than those in other industries. For example, for a software development engineering position, the salary drops by about 25% when switching from a pure internet company (average annual salary of 553,920 yuan) to a new energy vehicle company (average annual salary of 415,739 yuan). For an algorithm development engineering position in high-tech, the salary drops by about 28% when switching from a pure internet company (average annual salary of 641,916 yuan) to an electronic chip company (average annual salary of 461,872 yuan).</p>
							<p>For instance, the average yearly income for a software development engineer in an online company is about 550,000 RMB, whereas the same engineer's salary in a company that manufactures new energy vehicles is about 420,000 RMB. This indicates that a software development engineer's compensation would drop by around 24% if they switched from an internet company to a manufacturer of new energy vehicles. These numbers much exceed the official per capita income for China. The per capita disposable income in 2022 in China, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, was 36,883 yuan, which is equal to the monthly compensation of a software development engineer in a large technology firm.</p>
							<p>Chen said that the most important factor in job seeking is salary. "Salary reflects how much the company values me. For a fresh college graduate like me, money matters most. "</p>

							

							
							
							<p>Dachang not only offer competitive salaries to full-time employees, but also provide high salaries to interns. "During my internship at ByteDance, I earned 150 RMB per day in addition to a monthly housing allowance of 1000 RMB, and the company also provided three meals and afternoon tea," Dong Lue, a fourth-year student at South China University of Technology who interned at ByteDance and NetEase, said.</p>

The hairdryers in the gym's shower room are all Dyson," Dong said. "In addition, each gym offers group classes and personal training classes, including boxing, Pilates, and more. The prices are very affordable, with a personal training class costing only 150 RMB."</p>

									<p>However, the remuneration package of tech giants are facing pressure. The "2021-2022 New Economy Company Year-end Bonus Observation Report" by Maimai shows more than 35% of surveyed workers in China's internet technology industry said they received fewer bonuses this year than the previous year, while 33% saw no change. </p>

							<p>According to the report, one-third of millennials have family responsibilities and even if they are dissatisfied with their bonuses, they will not resign. However, more than half of the surveyed Generation Z respondents said they would "resign immediately or actively seek opportunities" if their bonuses were cut. "Work is for making money, not for charity. If the salary is reduced or bonuses are cut, I will consider changing jobs." said Chen.</p>
							<p>Becoming a part of the world-renowned big technology companies that impacts people's daily lives seems exciting. However, the debate about whether working at a tech giant is a good choice has become controversial in recent years. Qian Zhongshu, a renowned Chinese writer and literary scholar in the 20th century, quoted an old British saying in "Fortress Besieged" that marriage is like a gilded birdcage. The birds outside want to get in, and the birds inside want to get out. This saying seems to be a true prophecy for young people in this era, with the gilded birdcage being the internet giants.</p>
